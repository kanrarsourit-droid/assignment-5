# Dictionary and List Operations

This project demonstrates basic Python data structures: Dictionaries and Lists.

## Files Included

### 1. task1_marks.py (Dictionary Lookup)
- **Goal:** specific mark retrieval based on student name.
- **Functionality:**
    - Stores pre-defined marks for 5 students in a dictionary.
    - Accepts a name as input.
    - Checks if the name exists:
        - If **Found**: Prints the marks.
        - If **Not Found**: Prints an error message.

### 2. task2_slicing.py (List Manipulation)
- **Goal:** Demonstrate slicing and reversing lists.
- **Functionality:**
    - Generates a list of integers from 1 to 10.
    - Uses slicing syntax `[:5]` to extract the first 5 numbers.
    - Uses slicing syntax `[::-1]` to reverse that new sub-list.
    - Displays the original, extracted, and reversed lists.
